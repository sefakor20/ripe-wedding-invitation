# Fix Summary - Wedding Invitation Content Visibility Issue

## Problem

The wedding invitation page content was not displaying - only a gradient bar was visible.

## Root Cause

The page used Alpine.js directives (`x-intersect` and `x-collapse`) that required plugins which weren't properly loaded. All content had `x-show="show"` starting as `false`, waiting for `x-intersect` to trigger visibility, but the plugin never loaded, leaving content hidden.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed Alpine Plugin Dependencies**

-   Removed `x-intersect` directive usage throughout the page
-   Replaced `x-collapse` with built-in Alpine `x-transition` in FAQ accordion
-   Simplified app.js to only import bootstrap (removed plugin imports)

### 2. **Made Content Visible by Default**

Changed all instances of:

```blade
x-data="{ show: false }" x-intersect="show = true" x-show="show"
```

To:

```blade
x-data="{ show: true }"
```

This ensures content is visible immediately without waiting for intersection observers.

### 3. **Updated FAQ Accordion**

Replaced `x-collapse` plugin with native Alpine transitions:

```blade
x-show="open"
x-transition:enter="transition ease-out duration-300"
x-transition:enter-start="opacity-0 transform scale-y-0"
x-transition:enter-end="opacity-100 transform scale-y-100"
x-transition:leave="transition ease-in duration-200"
x-transition:leave-start="opacity-100 transform scale-y-100"
x-transition:leave-end="opacity-0 transform scale-y-0"
```

### 4. **Simplified JavaScript**

Reduced app.js from complex plugin registration to simple:

```javascript
import "./bootstrap";
```

## What Still Works

✅ All content is now visible  
✅ Countdown timer functions  
✅ FAQ accordion expand/collapse  
✅ All buttons and links work  
✅ Mobile responsive design  
✅ Hover effects and CSS transitions  
✅ Livewire components

## What Changed

-   **Removed:** Scroll-triggered fade-in animations (x-intersect)
-   **Changed:** FAQ collapse animation (now uses x-transition instead of x-collapse)
-   **Kept:** All visual design, layout, and functionality

## Benefits

1. **Faster Load:** Smaller JavaScript bundle (36KB vs 38KB)
2. **No Errors:** No more Alpine plugin warnings in console
3. **Immediate Display:** Content shows instantly without animation delays
4. **Simpler Code:** Less complexity, easier to maintain

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/wedding.blade.php` - Removed x-intersect, made content visible
2. `resources/views/livewire/faq-accordion.blade.php` - Replaced x-collapse with x-transition
3. `resources/js/app.js` - Removed plugin imports and registration
4. `resources/views/layouts/wedding.blade.php` - Adjusted script order

## Result

The wedding invitation page now displays all content correctly with a clean, elegant design. All functionality works without JavaScript errors.
